# NLP Logix Summer Bootcamp
On the main branch, we intend to post collaborative work we will share across teams for instructional purposes. From there, we can branch into separate ones and have the students commit their own work.

## Jupyter Notebook
Create general workbooks on the titanic dataset to demonstrate how to use the pandas library in python. This is planned to be used on the third week of the bootcamp, according to the curriculum.
